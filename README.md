# AgriAI
This IoT-based agricultural monitoring system uses sensors to track temperature, humidity, soil moisture, rainfall, and gas levels. The data is sent to the ThingSpeak cloud platform for analysis and displayed on an LCD. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are utilized for data insights and AI-driven analysis.
